<h1>SENSE - <i>SERVO ENABLED NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR EMPOWERMENT</i></h1>
<p>Digital accessibility remains a significant challenge for the visually impaired limiting
their ability to engage with online content. While screen readers and other assistive technologies
have made strides in improving accessibility, there is still a gap in providing a seamless and
physical reading experience. This project addresses this challenge by developing an innovative
system that converts web content into Braille using a combination of web scraping and
embedded systems.</p>

<p>To bridge these limitations, we aim to develop a working prototype. In this prototype, we
design and implement a single Braille letter representation unit using six servo motors to
simulate one Braille cell. This allows us to test and validate the system's feasibility on a smaller
scale before considering expansion. At the outset, Web Scraping is utilized to periodically
retrieve line-by-line textual content from online sources. Next, the scrapped text is passed
through a translation module. In which, the retrieved data is fragmented into singular words with
the use of a procedural language. Each word is then translated into Braille. The translated Braille
data is then sent to the hardware device over the internet. The embedded system interprets the
Braille data and displays it through a hardware device tailored to the requirement, utilizing
multiple actuators to represent the corresponding combinations of Braille cells. Frequent changes
in the website structure, handling dynamic content, dealing with CAPTCHA requirements,
retrieving only the essential data without losing its integrity and structure can prove to be a
challenge in the process. This system demands very specific hardware engineered to the
requirements of the setup. The assembly of the same can be unnecessarily expensive. Realizing
the hardware framework isn't particularly cost-efficient. This emerges as the primary challenge.
The only language the project plan aims to cater to is English. Hence, this system will prove to
be obsolete in regards to source data in other languages. In the English Language, the average
number of letters in a word is five-six, so it is advisable to accommodate just this much for the
hardware setup to make it cost effective. Hence, handling words with a number of letters higher
than that will be a challenging task with limited resources. While transmitting data via the
internet to the hardware system, one might face a real-time performance issue, as there might be
delay in data transmission and display updates. The designed hardware device should be robust
and should be able handle continual and sustained utilization.</p>
